                <p class="questions"><strong>What is ‘good’ screen-based design?</strong></p>
                  <p class="justify">I think that good screen-based design is web design that is fluid and smooth. There is no clutter and it is neatly organized allowing the user to navigate it without that much difficulty. A website that has a modern feel to it also good in my eyes. More minimalistic than anything.

                  </p>

                <p class="questions"><strong>How does the web impact graphic design?</strong></p>
                  <p class="justify">I think the web impacts Graphic Design now because Graphic designers have to keep up with the ever-changing arena that is online work. The web is constantly changing and logos/brands/companies always need to be a step ahead. There are things being developed everyday that change how people interact with the internet and it's our job as Graphic Designers to keep up with that constant change.I honestly think it's a good thing, albeit a little intimidating, that are major is always evolving/morphing into new ideas and expressions. It keeps us on our toes, as well as makes us become better designers in the long run.

                  </p>


                <p class="questions"><strong>How do you think screen-based design is going to change in the future?</strong></p>
                  <p class="justify">I think that screen-based design is going to change with the addition of VR/The HoloLens. VR is relatively new but people are now designing in VR, and designing with AR as well. I think that it won't be long until everyone is designing that way, and what would be considered the analog of then, would be designing on a computer.<br><br> I don’t know how I feel about it. I like designing on a computer and designing in VR sounds like a completely new frontier, or world even. But I also think that it would be quite nice to try and design in VR, if I ever get the opportunity to do so.
