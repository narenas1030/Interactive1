                <p class="questions"><strong>What is ‘good’ screen-based design?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think that good screen-based design is web design that is fluid and smooth. There is no clutter and it is neatly organized allowing the user to navigate it without that much difficulty. A website that has a modern feel to it also good in my eyes. More minimalistic than anything.

                  </p>

                <p class="questions"><strong>How does the web impact graphic design?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think the web impacts Graphic Design now because Graphic designers have to keep up with the ever-changing arena that is online work. The web is constantly changing and logos/brands/companies always need to be a step ahead. There are things being developed everyday that change how people interact with the internet and it's our job as Graphic Designers to keep up with that constant change. I honestly think it's a good thing, albeit a little intimidating, that are major is always evolving/morphing into new ideas and expressions. It keeps us on our toes, as well as makes us become better designers in the long run.

                  </p>

                <p class="questions"><strong>How do you think screen-based design is going to change in the future?</strong></p>
                  <p>I think that screen-based design is going to change with the addition of VR/The HoloLens. VR is relatively new but people are now designing in VR, and designing with AR as well. I think that it won't be long until everyone is designing that way, and what would be considered the analog of then, would be designing on a computer. I don’t know how I feel about it. I like designing on a computer and designing in VR sounds like a completely new frontier, or world even. But I also think that it would be quite nice to try and design in VR, if I ever get the opportunity to do so.
